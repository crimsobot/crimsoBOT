name: The Fool
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 0
image_filename: fool.jpg
description_upright: Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment. -Rumi
description_reversed: Bliss is ignorance.
element: Air
planet: Uranus
description_long: >
    A carefree young person steps out onto a sheer cliff, joyfully—and naively—plunging into the wild unknown. They bring with them only a few possessions in a little sack and carry a white rose, signifying their innocence. The dog at their feet is a protector, encouraging them to bravely embark on their journey.
description_long_reversed: >
    Innocence becomes willful ignorance, carefree becomes careless, when they are achieved by turning one's back on empathy. An apathetic fool is far from innocent: they are negligent, even complicit. It may be time to focus on important work.

name: The Magician
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 1
image_filename: magician.jpg
description_upright: Everything has come together, as if by magic...
description_reversed: Taken by an illusion, perhaps of one's own doing.
element: Air
planet: Mercury
description_long: >
    A commanding magician stands in a blossoming garden, ready to work their will. On the table before them are symbols of their great elemental power: a saber for air, a chalice for water, a pentacle for earth and a wand for fire. The Magician holds a magic scroll and points to both heaven and earth, signifying the Magician’s transcendent role as a bridge between the two.
description_long_reversed: >
    All four suits (and thus, all four elements) are depicted in The Magician; in an unsettled situation, all the pieces may be present, but not coming together. Imagine the unrest in your own mind when you can see all facets of a problem but you cannot arrive at the solution. Your intuition may need guidance from a place of trust: a friend, a healer, or a scholar.

name: The High Priestess
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 2
image_filename: highpriestess.jpg
description_upright: The High Priestess presides over the Hidden. They know the Secrets; can you?
description_reversed: That which is Hidden remains hidden. Now is not the time.
element: Water
planet: MOON
description_long: >
    Solemn and stately, a figure sits between two columns and in front of a veil, the moon at their feet and a lunar crown on their brow. In their lap they hold the scroll of divine secrets. The columns uphold the mystic Temple of Solomon and in their respective colors symbolize the journey from spiritual blindness to illumination. The veil behind the Priestess is the veil all initiates must pass through to behold the Mysteries and become enlightened.
description_long_reversed: >
    In the reverse, this card may indicate arrested emotional or spiritual development. This may also point toward intellectual vainglory, the holding of only surface knowledge of deeper mysteries. The element at play is still Water, indicating emotion, relationships, and intuition; how does this immix with the intellect (typically the realm of Air)? Perhaps what is holding you back from the fertile depths is emotional: fear, trauma, or even perfectionism.
---
name: The Empress
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 3
image_filename: empress.jpg
description_upright: The Empress, subtle and gentle, like water carves her will into stone.
description_reversed: Indecision, imbalance, undoing of fragile bonds.
element: Earth
planet: Venus
description_long: >
    A kind-faced Empress sits upon their throne amid the beauty and bounty of Nature, with which they exist in deep harmony. Their starry crown speaks to their title of Queen of Heaven and in their scepter is the power of life. They are the very Soul of the natural world, the power that makes all things grow and flourish. The Empress is all-loving, all-forgiving, and all-benevolent.
description_long_reversed: >
    Just as an upright Empress presides over the fruitful growth of new ideas or ventures, a reversed Empress may represent vacillation or even stagnation. However, as with other cards in the reverse, this is not necessarily an omen. For exmaple, perhaps it is best to stick to your original plan, or pore through old notes instead of struggling for new inspirations.
---
name: The Emperor
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 4
image_filename: emperor.jpg
description_upright: The Emperor is a great power. Bend the knee or suffer.
description_reversed: Mercy, benevolence, perhaps confusion and misdirection.
element: Fire
planet: Mars
description_long: >
    The absolute and unquestioned ruler of the world, The Emperor sits enthroned before a craggy mountain that echoes their unyielding nature. They hold an ankh scepter and a globe, both symbols of the Emperor’s dominion over all life, and their beard indicates their great wisdom. They are as severe as the Empress is kind, but just.
description_long_reversed: >
    It is crucial to frame the context of a card against the question you have asked and its position in the spread. The powerful Emperor card in the reverse can be interpreted as the Emperor yielding, choosing not to impose their power. Is this the world giving way to your passions, or are you failing to assert your desires to yourself or a loved one?
---
name: The Hierophant
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 5
image_filename: hierophant.jpg
description_upright: Those who Seek may find guidance in the Office of the Hierophant.
description_reversed: Society, community, organic expression; irreverence, weakness.
element: Earth
planet: Venus
description_long: >
    The Hierophant is the bridge between the human and the divine, and raises their hand in a gesture of blessing. They sit between the two pillars of Law and Liberty with the keys to Heaven beneath their feet. It is their duty to be the Teacher of Wisdom, to uphold tradition, and to mediate between humanity and God.
description_long_reversed: >
    Note the pyramidal (i.e., heirarchical) structure of the people in the card: two friars at the base, the Hierophant at the pinnacle. A reverseal signifies that an appeal toa central authority should yield to an appeal to the masses. In this appeal to society at large, however, you could risk overextending yourself by giving too much of yourself, or attemtpting to please too many disparate parties at once.
---
name: The Lovers
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 6
image_filename: lovers.jpg
description_upright: Love and beauty reign—pure, if not innocent.
description_reversed: Frustration, disharmony, vanity or narcissism.
element: Air
planet: Mercury
description_long: >
    Two figures stand naked before the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge. An angel hovers above them in a gesture of blessing and consecration. These two have nothing to hide from one another, and with the blessing of the angel and fertile space between them, are able to communicate clearly and honestly about their desires.
description_long_reversed: >
    It is too easy (and incorrect) to assume this card only appears when a romantic relationship is at the heart of a query; take care to apply it appropriately to your question. That said, one cannot ignore the reverse's imagery of the lovers being expelled from the Garden. This speaks to an end of innocence, or perhaps a disharmony within the Self or between two parties of a relationship.
---
name: The Chariot
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 7
image_filename: chariot.jpg
description_upright: A prince traverses the bridge between two. Unity, aid, victory.
description_reversed: Discord, litigation, quabbles, communication breakdown.
element: Water
planet: MOON
description_long: >
    A warrior stands proud and strong in a star-canopied chariot pulled by two sphinxes. The mallet on the chariot’s coat of arms represents self-control and the sphinxes symbolize passion and intellect—both must be in harmony for the chariot to move forward to victory. The warrior’s armor, adorned with crescent moons, speaks of things coming into being.
description_long_reversed: >
    The harmony and balance of The Chariot in reverse is thrust into disharmony and imbalance. The prince, instead of presiding over the passion and intellect, are now instead ruled by them. This may often have deleterious effects—tending toward impulsive or rash decisions, for example—but sometimes this upheaval of order can be refreshing and even necessary.
---
name: Strength
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 8
image_filename: strength.jpg
description_upright: True strength is not brutish but clever, and wielded with confidence.
description_reversed: Pride, abuse of power. Perilously forcing open the jaws of a lion.
element: Fire
planet: SUN
description_long: >
    On an open plain, a figure subdues a fierce lion with ease and calm. They fearlessly and easily control the beast without harming it or using excessive force. The eternity symbol hovering over their head suggests enlightenment, with the figure symbolizing spirit and the lion representing animal instincts.
description_long_reversed: >
    A reversal of strength is not weakness, but rather an abuse of strength. Note the card's element of fire—passion, will, motivation. True Strength is the harnessing of fire's energy, and its reversal signifies the perils. One may expect short-term gains from such a misuse of power, but eventually the fire will take that which was carelessly gained.
---
name: The Hermit
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 9
image_filename: hermit.jpg
description_upright: A light shines in the darkness. Those who would gain wisdom follow it deeper, deeper...
description_reversed: A thousand miles from nowhere. Loneliness, isolation, and bitterness.
element: Earth
planet: Mercury
description_long: >
    The Hermit stands upon a lonely mountain peak, guided through the darkness only by the Lamp of Truth and their trusty staff. They are the Fool all grown up—through hard-won wisdom and experience, the Fool has transformed into the wise Hermit. But the journey is far from over. The Hermit presses on in their search for enlightenment, alone perhaps, but undaunted.
description_long_reversed: >
    When presented this card in the reverse, examine whether the isolation in question is a fruitful (or willful) one. Many cards with a potentially negative meaning can be an invitation to "right the ship" and examine your innerspace in a new light. The Hermit is a prime opportunity to do this. Examine the isolation from a tempered, wisened perspective.
---
name: Wheel of Fortune
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 10
image_filename: wheeloffortune.jpg
description_upright: The Wheel spins, spins, spins. Today it favors you. Tomorrow...?
description_reversed: The world is maintained by change. Do not resist.
element: Fire
planet: Jupiter
description_long: >
    The Wheel is thick with symbolism. Upon its hub are inscribed the alchemical symbols of the elements, signifying the Wheel’s cosmic unity. The four creatures in each corner represent the four fixed signs of the zodiac. Anubis, the jackal god of fate, ascends on one side of the wheel while Apophis, the serpent of chaos descends on the other, showing that order and chaos are neither good nor evil but natural functions of our universe. A sphinx surmounts the Wheel, reminding us that our fate and the universe itself is a great riddle—one that is worthy to be explored but might never be solved.
description_long_reversed: >
    A wheel upside-down is still just that. Be careful not to let yourself become too fixated on interpreting this card as good fortune or bad fortune. Meditate, rather, on how the dynamic forces of fortune may be working in your situation. A reversed Fortune may indicate that such fortune may be more chaotic, complex, or simply quicker. New opportunities may require swifter action.
---
name: Justice
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 11
image_filename: justice.jpg
description_upright: The truth does not care about our needs or wants. It does not care about our idealogies or religions. It will lie in wait for all time.
description_reversed: You know what you've done. How long can you hide it?
element: Air
planet: Venus
description_long: >
    Justice sits between two pillars representing Law and Order, and behind them is hung the purple tapestry of Mercy. In one hand Justice lifts the sword of logic that cuts through deceptions and equivocations and in the other holds the scales of fairness and impartiality. Their square crown bespeaks their well-ordered mind. Justice is stern and firm, but fair.
description_long_reversed: >
    Note the parallels between Strength and Justice; those parallels hold in the reverse as well. Reversed justice usually does not denote a complete lack of justice, but rather its misapplication, forexample excessive severity or bias. Meditate on whether you are the perpetrator, the victim, or a witness to this.
---
name: The Hanged Man
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 12
image_filename: hangedman.jpg
description_upright: A new perspective is needed to see clearly. Pause and surrender to it.
description_reversed: Delays, resistance; indecision and muddled thoughts.
element: Water
planet: Neptune
description_long: >
    The Hanged Man is depicted suspended upside down from a living tree. This is not a punishment, however: their serene face suggests they are here of their own accord, and the halo around their head suggests the reason is to attain enlightenment. The Hanged Man is seeking a new perspective in a radical way—they long to literally stand the world on its head and thereby see something they might have missed while right side up. The Hanged Man is willing to endure great pain for what they seek.
description_long_reversed: >
    The Hanged Man in reverse appears to be simply standing upright on one leg. Instead of gaining a new perspective, the upright man on one leg is either struggling to gain the new perspective they seek, or delaying the work needed to gain it. One could even go so far as to presume the man on one leg to be vain, giving only a half-measure toward the work of renewal and clarity.
---
name: Death
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 13
image_filename: death.jpg
description_upright: The Death of the old comes to clear the way for the new.
description_reversed: Fear of change leaves one trapped in limbo, neither living nor dead.
element: Water
planet: Pluto
description_long: >
    Death, in its invincible armor, rides a pale horse and carries a banner depicting a white rose, both symbols of Death’s power of purification. Kings, peasants, and clergy are all laid low before Death—it respects neither wealth nor power but comes to all equally. And yet in the distance, the sun rises. Death may be the end, but it is necessary for rebirth.
description_long_reversed: >
    Tarot is often misinterpreted as a means of divination, each card capable of predicting the future. Death is perhaps the card most responsible for this misconception. Just as upright Death does not portend one's demise, neither does reversed Death mean one will cheat death. This card reversed often indicates lethargy, refusing to accept the end, and thus perpetually delaying renewal.
---
name: Temperance
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 14
image_filename: temperance.jpg
description_upright: Balance, moderation, and patience obtain all things.
description_reversed: Dissipation, imbalance. The cup runneth over, and may soon run out.
element: Fire
planet: Jupiter
description_long: >
    A winged figure stands in a shallow pool, one foot in the water and one foot on land, symbolizing unity of body and spirit. In their hands they are pouring a mixture from one chalice to another, creating something new from the mingling of two separate substances. Temperance is an alchemist, seeking unity from dissolution of separateness. They must be moderate and precise in their measurements, or their experiment will be ruined.
description_long_reversed: >
    Note the elemental symbol for Fire, the upright triangle, on the winged figure's robe. Temperance is the balance of fiery will and passion with fluid emotion and intuition. In the reverse, this balance falters. Reflect upon competing forces to determine if this imbalance a necessary shift or a brewing dissonance.
---
name: The Devil
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 15
image_filename: devil.jpg
description_upright: Your Shadow Self is weary of being in chains. Set it free.
description_reversed: Addiction, shame; self-limiting beliefs and anxieties.
element: Earth
planet: Saturn
description_long: >
    The Devil sits perched in a dark place with two hapless beings—the Lovers—in his thrall. The Devil is a figure of contradictions: his appearance is unsettling and loathsome, yet his open hand is raised in a gesture of peace and blessing. His brow is crowned with the inverted pentagram of materiality, yet he holds a torch of enlightenment. He has his prisoners chained, yet the chains are clearly quite loose. In the end, the Devil is only that which we are afraid of within ourselves, and must confront in order to achieve peace.
description_long_reversed: >
    Much like Death, the Devil is another unjustly feared card in the Tarot deck. Your soul is not damned by its presence. A reversed Devil, however, does serve as a dire warning. The struggles it indicates—axniety, pettiness, ignornace, or even addiction—are all notoriously self-replicating, creating a vicious cycle from which it becomes more difficult to escape with every passing hour.
---
name: The Tower
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 16
image_filename: tower.jpg
description_upright: The Tower is struck, bringing chaos, upheaval, and the end of the illusion of control.
description_reversed: Disaster has been averted, perhaps narrowly. Rejoice—for now.
element: Fire
planet: Mars
description_long: >
    Lightning splits the air and strikes The Tower, setting it ablaze and hurling its occupants into the darkness. A crown falls from the top of The Tower, the ultimate symbol of the loss of control. For that is what the destruction of The Tower represents: the loss of security, control, and the status quo. Things must be shaken up—even violently—or else the world will fall into stagnation and rot.
description_long_reversed: >
    This is perhaps too literal of a reading of the card's imagery, but: Imagine yourself trapped in an inverted tower, imprisoned below the surface of the sea. If that tower were destroyed, you would escape and float back to the surface toward freedom and fresh air. Though you are ultimately in a better situation than before, you are still lost at sea.
---
name: The Star
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 17
image_filename: star.jpg
description_upright: The Stars sing with their light, a shining chorus of hope and renewal.
description_reversed: Disconnection, lack of purpose, stagnation. The Universe holds no wonder, only the cold light of unreachable worlds.
element: Air
planet: Uranus
description_long: >
    Surrounded by a lush landscape, the Star pours water from two containers (the conscious and the subconscious) to further nourish the earth. With one foot in the water and one on dry land, the Star is balanced in their practical sensibilities and their intuition. Their nakedness is a token of their spiritual vulnerability and openness, the stars in the sky behind them symbols of spiritual awakening and hope.
description_long_reversed: >
    While the reverse of the Star—an atrophied sense of wonder, a loss of purpose, intellectual stagntation—do not be dismayed. No one card or one reading is a sentence, but rather a revelation. Reflect on the disconnect or the cause of the stagnation and open yourself to new opportunities to rediscover wonder.
---
name: The Moon
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 18
image_filename: moon.jpg
description_upright: Monsters and demons come out to play in the moonlit night—but are they real?
description_reversed: The Moon lights the night, leading the way out of fear, confusion, and repressed emotions.
element: Water
planet: Neptune
description_long: >
    The Moon broods over a gloomy and uncanny landscape, shedding fertilizing dew. A crawfish crawls out of a pool, symbolizing the subconscious mind, towards a wild wolf and a dog, representing our fears and our illusions. Two pillars rise in the distance, the doors of our perception, the portals to our turbulent unconscious minds full of both creativity and nightmares. The only way out of this strange, dreamlike place is through it.
description_long_reversed: >
    This card shows a moonlit path, and though this path is perilous in a way, it can be traversed. A reversed Moon may indicate that you have already found the path and the key to handling the phantoms that dare haunt you along the way.
---
name: The Sun
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 19
image_filename: sun.jpg
description_upright: Light, warmth, and vitality. The Sun radiates over all, bringing abundance and cheer.
description_reversed: Do not fly too close to the sun, lest your wings turn to ash. Keep your feet firmly planted on the ground.
element: Fire
planet: SUN
description_long: >
    The Sun smiles down approvingly upon an innocent child riding a horse, holding aloft a red banner of life and vitality. All is well. Flowers bloom, innocence prevails, and life is renewed by The Sun’s bright glow. The Sun’s illumination is a cause of joy for those who are blameless and have nothing to hide, but those who harbor secrets must be wary.
description_long_reversed: >
    Above all others, the Sun's power and majesty reign. We must live in accordance with it; too little and we must seek more, too much and we must seek shelter. A reverse Sun could be warning you to reassess your relationship with your central passion, the fire that burns greatest in your life. You must remain innocent in its light, taking care not to be greedy for more than your share.
---
name: Judgement
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 20
image_filename: judgement.jpg
description_upright: The trumpet sounds, calling you to rise from the grave into new life, into greatness. Arise!
description_reversed: Self-doubt and negative self-talk abound. Extend to yourself the hand of mercy, not the fist of retribution.
element: Fire
planet: Pluto
description_long: >
    An angel blows their great trumpet, calling the dead to arise from their tombs at the end of time. The mountains in the distance are high and insurmountable—none will escape this final and cosmic judgement. This is not only an end but The End, of Time, of the World As We Know It. After this will come renewal. The world will never be the same.
description_long_reversed: >
    Much of the Judeo-Christian symbolism does not carry the weight with most querents today as it once did, but the messages these symbols convey in the Tarot are still applicable. Though the converse of Judgment may imply damnation, that your soul was not ready for salvation when the trumpt sounded, once agian be cautioned not to interpret any one card so ominously. Perhaps you have missed the call to renewal this time, or perhaps the call is coming soon and you need to focus now on your inner work to ensure your pneuma is prepared for the new world to come.
---
name: The World
suit: MAJOR_ARCANA
number: 21
image_filename: world.jpg
description_upright: All shall be well, all shall be well; all manner of things shall be well.
description_reversed: The quickest path does not always bring success. Learning the hard way is often the best way.
element: Earth
planet: Saturn
description_long: >
    A triumphant figure dances in the ether, amid the final completion and enlightenment of the cosmos. They step fearlessly through a wreath of victory, watched over by four creatures who represent the four elements. All is well now, and all will be well. The universe is whole, all is in harmony…until the cycle of time begins again.
description_long_reversed: >
    The World reversed is not so much a manner of saying that all will not be well, but rather that the ultimate resolution it signifies is not yet yours. You likely see the culmination of your efforts coming to a head, and you can practically smell the fruits of your labor, but be patient. You may be tempted to take shortcuts; be wary though of ill-gotten gains. In an extreme case you might be denied those fruits and unwilling to accept the loss, when the reward is so close. Be like water: carve your will patiently into the Earth.
---
name: Ace of Wands
suit: WANDS
number: 1
image_filename: wands-01.jpg
description_upright: The new green shoots of spring are emerging, unfurling with pure potential.
description_reversed: Delays, distractions, and lack of direction cause new growth to wither on the vine.
element: Fire
description_long: >
    A godlike hand extends from the clouds, bearing a wand sprouting with fresh growth. The Aces are the primordial seeds of their suits, and being in the element of fire, the potential energy of the Ace of Wands is tremendous. It is the raw, unfocused power of the will to manifest one’s highest goals and deepest desires. This wild, untamed energy must be harnessed if it is to be of any use—uncontrolled it will only be a short-lived flash in the pan.
description_long_reversed: >
    Whereas in the upright the Ace is an invitation to seize the powers of will and desire, the reverse is a warning of misfocused energies and unforseen delays. Refelct on what must be done to revive the new growth.
---
name: Two of Wands
suit: WANDS
number: 2
image_filename: wands-02.jpg
description_upright: A plan of action is needed to bring inspiration to fruition.
description_reversed: Fear of the unknown, poor planning; inner alignment is thrown off and must be righted.
element: Fire
description_long: >
    A person gazes out towards the horizon from a city wall, flanked by two wands, a globe in their hands. Twos are power conduits of their suits—the initial focusing of the raw power of the Ace. As the fiery power of the Wands is harnessed, it opens up a world of possibility. Like the figure gazing out at the sea, the world is literally in one’s hands. Anything is possible.
description_long_reversed: >
    The interpretation of any reversed Two is straightforward enough: a lack of focus of the energies of that suit's element. The Two of Wands reversed is the lack of focused passion, which can manifest as anything from idle fidgeting to a visceral anxiety.
---
name: Three of Wands
suit: WANDS
number: 3
image_filename: wands-03.jpg
description_upright: Progress, expansion, and opportunity. The horizon is yours.
description_reversed: Playing it safe will get you nowhere. Do not dare not to dare.
element: Fire
description_long: >
    Very similar to the Two of Wands, a lone figure gazes out at the horizon to the mountains over the sea, flanked now by three wands. Threes represent the potential energy of their suits becoming crystalized in material form. This is why, unlike in the Two of Wands, the figure is now outside the city walls and the horizon is a little closer. They are no longer planning and dreaming of their goal, but have taken the first act of will towards attaining it.
description_long_reversed: >
    The upright, resolute figure in this card, when reversed, can be seen as wavering or doubtful. Meditate on how this card makes you feel in the spread. Is the doubt due diligence or self-defeating?
---
name: Four of Wands
suit: WANDS
number: 4
image_filename: wands-04.jpg
description_upright: Celebration, joy, and harmony are the order of the day. Savor them.
description_reversed: Do you trust those closest to you?
element: Fire
description_long: >
    A wedding canopy of four wands stands straight and tall, covered with fruitful greenery, while revelers in the background walk towards it, joyfully raising bouquets in their hands. Fours are the stabilization of their elements, and this makes the Wands’ fire bright, joyful, and a beacon of union. The Four of Wands is the harmonizing of one’s actions with one’s inner will.
description_long_reversed: >
    When you feel wavering passion in a stable or stabilizing relationship, take the opportunity to examine the reasons why. From where does this faltering trust flow? The reasons could be numerous; a couple of extreme examples are fear of commitment or codependency. (Remember not to automatically default to the most dire conclusions when presented a reversed card—or any card, for that matter.)
---
name: Five of Wands
suit: WANDS
number: 5
image_filename: wands-05.jpg
description_upright: Discord is sown, to no discernible end. Gridlock, tension, and futility.
description_reversed: Inner turmoil stews. It is best to reckon with it sooner rather than later.
element: Fire
description_long: >
    Five figures appear in a scene of struggle, their weapons locked in a jumbled mess. No one can win in this scenario, all they can do is push vainly against each other. This is the state of the Wands’ fire in the realm of Five—Fives are the inevitable destabilization of their suits, and while Four was able to control fire for a time, fire resents being suppressed and threatens to break into an inferno. Five of Wands is all pent-up (and potentially toxic) energy.
description_long_reversed: >
    Turmoil is a given in life. You might be wise to find a way to use this discord to your advantage. Instead of rebelling against this seemingly negative energy, accept it, and perhaps then you will find a clever way forward.
---
name: Six of Wands
suit: WANDS
number: 6
image_filename: wands-06.jpg
description_upright: Victory is at hand.
description_reversed: Hubris, arrogance, and the resulting fall.
element: Fire
description_long: >
    Figures march in a victory procession with the laurel-crowed victor in the foreground, proudly displaying their trophy for all to see. The realm of Six generally depicts the suits and their elements at their best, and the best of Wands is successfully harnessing the will to attain a great desire. The battle has been won, victory has been declared, and the spoils are enjoyed. The fiery power of the will has done its work.
description_long_reversed: >
    This is a good moment to look at the progression of a suit: Fours represent stability, Fives an inevitable destabilization, and Sixes depict the suits (and their elements) at their best. Imagine this sequence, except ending with a six in the Reverse; a recent trial may show signs of relenting, but be wary of celebrating too soon. 
---
name: Seven of Wands
suit: WANDS
number: 7
image_filename: wands-07.jpg
description_upright: Hold your ground and let none take what you have fought hard to earn.
description_reversed: The battle has been lost, but not the war.
element: Fire
description_long: >
    A grim-faced person stands atop a hill, vigorously fighting to defend what was won in Six from the wands thrusting upward—and they appear determined to succeed, no matter the cost. Sevens are the realm of instinct, emotion, and the unconscious mind. They can be both creative and chaotic. In Seven, the fire of Wands manifests as aggressiveness, dogged determination to survive, and the stubborn refusal to give in.
description_long_reversed: >
    The numbered cards can be viewed as a sequence, or a story. What may have been won in the Six is now subject to the chaos of the unconscious mind represented in the Seven. Chaos is not inherently bad, but it is certainly unwieldy. The Seven of Wands in reverse can signify or warn of a setback due to letting your passion or aggression get the best of you, and is an invitation to reflect on how this happened.
---
name: Eight of Wands
suit: WANDS
number: 8
image_filename: wands-08.jpg
description_upright: Forward motion, dynamism, propulsion. Things are in motion that cannot be stopped.
description_reversed: What's the rush? Planning and patience is needed, not haste.
element: Fire
description_long: >
    Eight wands fly through the air, as though thrown or launched with great force. Eights are the intellectual and logical manifestations of their suits, and when the fire of Wands meets the mind the result is a spectacular burst of creative energy.
description_long_reversed: >
    You feel that you are about to embark upon an idea, project, or another significant undertaking, but that undertaking might not be ready to manifest into reality. Be sure that your aim is true before you send these wands flying—do not be rash or impatient.

element: Fire
description_long: >
    Standing before eight wands, a lone figure holds a ninth in their hand. They appear a little worse for wear, but vigilant and ready to defend their turf. Nine is the number of wisdom and integration; so far the fiery Wands have learned to harness, regulate, and use their energy for the good. They can now stand down for the moment and enjoy a rest in between conquests.
description_long_reversed: >
    Recall the Eight of Wands's imagery of eight wands flying through the air. Imagine that those eight wands let loose did not fly true; misguided passion has landed you in a place you did not want to be. The wand-holder in the reversed Nine of Wands is less wise and more weary, knowing how much work must be done to realign their passions with thier reality.

description_long: >
    Burdened beneath a seemingly impossible bundle of wands much larger than themselves, a person struggles onward to a house in the distance. Tens represent completion and the ultimate manifestation of the elements of their suits, with all the lessons they’ve learned along the way. The explosive energy of Wands has channeled itself into a multitude outlets—at the risk of overextending and diluting itself. As with the person hauling all ten Wands, regulation and conservation of energy is key.

  A youth stands amid desert dunes, staff planted and head raised high as though they are about to declare an important message. Indeed the Pages in all suits indicate communication and potential messages—whether to or from actual people or one’s own subconscious. The Page of Wands is Earth in Fire, communicating fire’s sometimes inscrutable and flickering will with earthy common sense.

  An armored knight, visor raised, charges heedlessly through a desert landscape, flames seeming to stream from their helm. Their bright mantle is decorated with salamanders, creatures of the element of fire. Knights suggest travel, movement, and the coming and going of circumstances. With the Knight of Wands that movement happens at lightning pace for they are the element of air within the suit of fire, fuel to the flames.

description_long: >
  The brightly-robed Queen sits on their flowery throne, seemingly all sunlight and warmth—but the black cat at their feet bespeaks a more than passing acquaintance with magic and the Shadow self. This Queen, being water in fire, is the emotional center of the suit of Wands. They balance the dominating energy of fire with compassion, generosity, and humor.

description_reversed: Are you using your power, or abusing it?
element: Fire in Fire
description_long: >
  Enthroned in an arid landscape, the King of Wands gazes outward and rules their realm not with an iron fist but a blossoming staff. Kings are the motivators of their suits, the charismatic leaders who draw up plans and strategize. The King of Wands is especially adept at this with their abundance of fiery energy. They rouse one to press onward towards one’s goal, to blow on the spark of one’s will and fan it into a dazzling flame.

description_reversed: Hold tightly to what you have and do not take it for granted.
element: Earth
description_long: >
  Amid a lush landscape, a hand appears from the clouds to offer a huge gold coin. The entire scene speaks of abundance: the garden, the grass, the flowers, and the riches freely offered. Yet the mountains in the distance remind that hard work and determination is required to bring such abundance to fruition. The Aces are the primordial seeds of their suits, and being of earth, the Pentacles are all about germination. The Ace of Pentacles is all about opportunity: economic, social, practical. It is the seed from which a great harvest will grow—but it needs nurturing.

description_upright: If resources are not managed carefully, they may fall right out of your hands.
description_reversed: The limit is in danger of being exceeded. How much longer can you hold on?
element: Earth
description_long: >
  A youth appears to dance while balancing two large coins linked by an infinity symbol. Behind him two ships ride the great waves of the ocean. The infinity symbol implies the youth can handle this up and down dance forever if they must; the ships on the sea speak to the same. Life has its little everyday ups and downs but they are manageable—if one is wise. Twos are power conduits of their suits—the initial focusing of the raw power of the Ace. Earthy Pentacles don’t like two much movement, but the earth is also maintained by constant changes every moment. In the realm of Two, the Pentacles slowly begin to make the transition from seed to sprout.

description_long: >
  Chiseling away, a young stonemason works at constructing a wall while two architects hold their plans and instruct. All three appear to be discussing how to proceed, valuing each others’ opinion and knowledge of their crafts. Threes represent the potential energy of their suits becoming crystalized in material form. Much interconnected work and activity must be done for the element of earth bear fruit: rain, changes in soil chemistry, photosynthesis, pollination, and more. Hard-working Pentacles are very happy in the realm of Three.

description_reversed: More, more, more--but at what cost?
element: Earth
description_long: >
  What appears to be a richly-mantled noble clutches a coin to their chest. One is balanced on their head and two more are secured under the noble’s feet. The distant city looms. Fours are the stabilization of their elements, and the element of earth is very comfortable here—too comfortable. The risk of earth’s stagnation and inflexibility comes to fruition in this scene: the figure must be utterly still and withdrawn to hold onto their coins, or at least they believe they must. It does not occur to them that there might be a better way. They are uninterested in trying anything new.

element: Earth
description_long: >
  Two destitute figures trudge through the snow, cold and dejected. Behind them a large window depicting five coins glows with cheerful light. For whatever reason, the two are not welcome inside. Fives are the inevitable destabilization of their suits, and earth does not like being moved even under the best of circumstances. In the realm of Five, the earthy Pentacles tend to panic and interpret this natural destabilization as a catastrophe. So while the frozen wanderers may think their situation will never change, it is only a temporary setback.

description_long: >
  A wealthy benefactor freely drops coins into the hands of the dejected pair last seen in the Five of Pentacles. The generous giver holds a pair of scales in their other hand, symbolizing a fair and equitable society, as well as redistribution of wealth. The realm of Six generally depicts the suits and their elements at their best, and the best of Pentacles is the generous sharing of material abundance for the good of all. Practical earth understands that fairness, equality, and justice aren’t just lofty ideas—they require that all are ensured access to material resources.

description_reversed: You can't get blood from a stone, or much of anything besides stone for that matter. Expend energy elsewhere.
element: Earth
description_long: >
  Resting their head on the handle of their hoe, a farmer surveys their growing harvest (symbolized by seven coins) almost balefully. Their hard work is paying off, but has left them quite exhausted. Sevens are the realm of instinct, emotion, and the unconscious mind. They can be both creative and chaotic. In the realm of Seven, the earth of Pentacles manifests as fretting over the future—whether hard work will pay off, what the results will eventually be, whether the long-term goal is really worth it.

  A laborer sits before a tower of six pentacles. This is clearly a work in progress as the laborer is chiseling a new addition to the tower and another uncompleted disk lays at their feet. They appear content and caught up in the flow of their work. Eights are the intellectual and logical manifestations of their suits, and in the earth of Pentacles this manifest as steady, uninterrupted, hands-on work that gets the job done right.

description_reversed: Overwork & lack of self-worth. Your worth lies beyond your ability to produce.
element: Earth
description_long: >
  An aristocratic figure stands in the midst of a beautiful lush garden overflowing with fruit and flowers. The flowers on their robe and the hooded falcon on their arm all attest to the person’s refinement. The expression on their face is ambivalent—they are neither overjoyed nor dismayed at their surroundings; all of this rich abundance is theirs by right and they are simply used to it. Nine is the number of wisdom and integration; so far the earthy Pentacles have learned to work hard for material gain, and to be content with the results of their labor.

    In an arched courtyard an elder sits surrounded by their wealth and family. The coins that dot the scene are arranged in the form of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, signifying completion, wholeness, and harmony. Tens represent completion and the ultimate manifestation of the elements of their suits, with all the lessons they’ve learned along the way. The earth of the Pentacles ultimately manifests as material security, domestic stability, and long-term harmony in all practical matters.

description_reversed: Do not lose sight of your original inspiration; minimize distractions.
element: Earth in Earth
description_long: >
  On an open plain with trees and mountains in the background, a young Page stands tall and gazes at the coin in their hands. The Pages in all suits indicate communication and potential messages—whether to or from actual people or one’s own subconscious. Being earth in earth, the Page of Pentacles has perhaps the most common sense of all the Pages, to the point of being blunt and unimaginative. Whatever message they give will be clear, and to the point.

element: Air in Earth
description_long: >
  A knight on horseback gazes out over bare fields that will soon sprout with crops, a single coin in their hand. Knights suggest travel, movement, and the coming and going of circumstances. With the Knight of Pentacles, this movement is bound to be cautious and well-thought-out. The swiftness of their native air is slowed and stabilized by the earth of Pentacles, and they counsel patience in all things.

  The Queen sits enthroned amid a lush landscape full of flowers, fruits, and vines, gazing at the coin in their hands. Being water in earth, they are the emotional center of the Suit of Pentacles, something the material-minded Pentacles often lacks. The Queen of Pentacles knows that material stability is just a means to an end—the foundation of the hierarchy of needs that allows deeper desires like love, belonging, and self actualization to be realized.

description_long: >
  The King of Pentacles is a jolly, good-natured soul. Their throne is decorated with bulls, symbols of vitality and virility, as well as the vegetation god Dionysus whom the King takes after in appearance and demeanor. The King’s cloak bears further Dionysian imagery, being covered in a design of grapes. Kings are the motivators of their suits, the charismatic leaders who draw up plans and strategize. This King, the vital fire of ever-practical earth, is not concerned with grand battles or playing four-dimensional chess, but with ensuring that their people flourish and are provided for.

  A hand holds out an abundantly flowing chalice above a sea of lotuses while a white dove hovers over all. The chalice is the subconscious mind, its five streams the five senses, the lotuses below harbingers of spiritual awakening, the diving dove a symbol of divine love. The Aces are the wellsprings of their suits, and as the entire suit of Cups rules the heart and emotions, the Ace of Cups is the Holy Grail of feeling and intuition. It flows with utterly pure love and intimacy unsullied by suspicion or self-interest.

  Two figures gaze intently at each other while passing two cups between them. Above them hovers a serpent-wand and the winged head of a chimera, symbols of the dynamic, almost alchemical, connection between the two. Twos are power conduits of their suits—the initial focusing of the raw power of the Ace. In the Ace of Cups, formless, flowing water is given boundaries and direction—things it desperately needs to avoid becoming a flood.

  Three jubilant revelers dance together in perfect harmony amid a fruitful garden, their cups held high. The water element of the suit of Cups is very happy in the realm of Three.

element: Water
description_long: >
  A sullen figure sits with crossed legs and crossed arms against a tree, three cups in front of them and one offered to them from a divinely-appearing hand. The figure appears to want nothing to do with any of them. Fours are the stabilization of their elements, and this makes the watery Cups very unhappy. Like the figure beneath the tree, being dammed up makes water sullen and stagnant.

  Cloaked and downcast, a person stands before three spilt cups with two upright cups behind them. They face a distant flowing river and the bridge that crosses it. Fives are the inevitable destabilization of their suits, and while water doesn’t like to be dammed up, its emotional nature craves some level of structure and security. Doubt and emotional turmoil reign in the Five of Cups, spilling everywhere.

description_long: >
  Two children play happily together, surrounded by six chalices full of blossoms. The high walls behind them and the sentry in the distance suggest that they are utterly secure—this is the world of a child’s mind where everything is beautiful and nothing hurts. The realm of Six generally depicts the suits and their elements at their best, and the best of the Cups is love, pure and innocent. Within the harmony and security of Six, a utopian world of unassailable vulnerability and unbroken trust prevails.

element: Water
description_long: >
  A bewildered figure finds themselves before a dreamlike tableau.  Seven chalices float before them, full of treasures, honors, pleasures—but also serpents, dragons, and veiled mysteries. Sevens are the realm of instinct, emotion, and the unconscious mind. They can be both creative and chaotic. In Seven, the water of the suit of Cups is beautiful but treacherous, reflecting fantastic shapes that may or may not be real. Water is a master illusionist and is nowhere more mischievous or clever than the Seven of Cups.

element: Water
description_long: >
  Beneath a sad-faced moon, a bent figure walks toward a forbidding mountain range, leaving behind eight empty cups. Eights are the intellectual and logical manifestations of their suits, and this spells nothing but disillusionment for the dreamy Cups who become frustrated when their every utopian vision is not realized.

    A fellow in a funny, fishy hat stands on the shore of the sea holding a chalice out of which pops an actual fish—which appears to be talking to them. They don’t seem the least bit surprised or concerned. In fact they seem amused by this quirky turn of events. No wonder—their lotus-adorned tunic speaks to their open-mindedness and keen insight. Pages in all suits indicate communication and potential messages—whether to or from actual people or one’s own subconscious. And whatever the Page of Cups has to say, who as Earth in Water knows the dangers of being too serious, you can bet it will get your attention.

description_reversed: Emotions are not weapons to be used against others or yourself.
element: Air in Water
description_long: >
  A Knight rides through an arid desert through which runs a precious, thirst-quenching river. Perhaps they hope to fill their empty chalice there. Their mantle of fishes symbolize the water of the Cups, but their winged helm and boots remind us that they are an airy being, more intellectual than emotional. The scarcity of water in their surroundings suggests they would be wise to use more of their heart along with their head.  Knights suggest travel, movement, and the coming and going of circumstances. With the Knight of Cups movement may be more of a meandering flow than a linear trip from point A to point B.

  Beautiful and gentle, the Queen of Cups sits on a throne of shells and sea-nymphs at the edge of a placid sea, a chalice with handles in the form of cherubim in their hand. Their chalice is unlike any in the entire suit of Cups. It is closed, symbolizing both their deep subconscious as well as their wise discretion in how they share their emotions, and who with. The bowl of the chalice sits between two cherubim-shaped handles, signifying that although one’s subconscious is a dark place, it is also a holy place. It is life and strength, not knowledge and words that one finds there. The Queen’s feet do not touch the water, showing that they have learned how to relate positively to their emotions without being overwhelmed by them.

Kings are the motivators of their suits, the charismatic leaders who draw up plans and strategize.

  A person sits with the sea at their back, blindfolded, holding two swords pointing in opposite directions. Though they are blindfolded, their calm and centered demeanor suggests they have voluntarily placed the blindfold upon themselves in order to more deeply meditate upon the choice before them, symbolized by the swords. The sea and the moon in the background represent the unconscious mind, the deeper realm that must be called upon to make important decisions. Twos are power conduits of their suits—the initial focusing of the raw power of the Ace. Here the immaterial intellect is called upon to effect change in the material world.

  Suspended in the midst of a gloomy, rainy sky, a heart is pierced by three crossed swords. Threes represent the potential energy of their suits becoming crystalized in material form, and unfortunately the old adage holds true for the Three of Swords: “he who increases wisdom increases sorrow.” The cerebral Swords, like the emotional Cups, are easily disillusioned but lack the Cups’ propensity for hope. They cannot easily un-see or un-know.

  Two defeated and humiliated figures move into the distance while their smug conqueror collects their discarded swords. Fives are the inevitable destabilization of their suits, and uncontrolled air blows fiercely in the realm Five.

    A boatman ferries two somber passengers across a river, six swords adorning the prow of the boat before them. Ahead the water is placid, but behind them the current is turbulent. This suggests the two passengers are leaving an unhappy situation for a new future—but the swords at the prow speak to the possibility that it still weighs heavily on their minds. Sixes generally depict the suits at their best, and for the more serious Swords that doesn’t mean the utopian happiness of the Cups or free-flowing abundance of the Pentacles, but sobriety of mind and clarity of thought. The air of the Swords pushes one on from what no longer serves into the possibility of the future.

name: Seven of Swords
suit: SWORDS
number: 7
image_filename: swords-07.jpg
description_upright: The thief creeps about, their mind full of nothing but treachery and betrayal.
description_reversed: You may tell yourself that everything is well and good--but is it?
element: Air
description_long: >
  Unnoticed,  thief has stolen into a military camp and made off with five of their swords. The thief looks behind at two swords they have dropped, seeming proud of their ability to sneak in and out without raising the alarm. But they must be careful—the way they are carrying those swords, they risk being cut to ribbons. Sevens are the realm of instinct, emotion, and the unconscious mind. They can be both creative and chaotic. In the realm of Seven, air manifests as cunning and manipulation, seeking its own advantage and how it can use its intelligence to its own benefit. Care must be taken, however, for the element not to fall victim to its own cleverness and become caught up in its own convoluted plots.

name: Eight of Swords
suit: SWORDS
number: 8
image_filename: swords-08.jpg
description_upright: A ring of Swords surrounds, imprisoning the mind in fear and uncertainty.
description_reversed: The mind must be refreshed time to time by new and unfamiliar ideas.
element: Air
description_long: >
  A figure stands in a ring of eight swords, blindfolded and bound round the torso, but not tightly. The water at their feet suggests that their subconscious mind might know a solution to the predicament their eyes cannot see. This is ultimately a scene of self-limitation—this person could easily shake off their loosely-tied bonds, remove the blindfold, and step out of the open ring of swords without a scratch. Eights are the intellectual and logical manifestations of their suits, and with air this becomes a dangerous excess of reason. Overthinking and overanalyzing leaves the Swords trapped in a prison of their own making.

name: Nine of Swords
suit: SWORDS
number: 9
image_filename: swords-09.jpg
description_upright: Anxiety, fear, and worry turn the mind into a living nightmare. It is time to wake up.
description_reversed: The sun is quickly rising upon fear and delusion--the nightmare is almost over.
element: Air
description_long: >
  In a pitch-black room, a figure sits up in bed, their head in their hands, as though woken from a nightmare they cannot shake. Nine swords brood over their anguish. Nine is the number of wisdom and integration—for the Swords and the element of air, this wisdom is often an awakening from mental confusion and even intoxication. The piercing insight of the Swords is like a cold shower or cup of black coffee after a night of debauchery—unpleasant maybe, but it brings one to one’s senses.

name: Ten of Swords
suit: SWORDS
number: 10
image_filename: swords-10.jpg
description_upright: The Swords have reaped the consequences of their violence--they cannot give life, only destroy it.
description_reversed: Redemption, recovery, & regeneration. Destruction is avoidable.
element: Air
description_long: >
    The scene of a brutal murder: a victim with not one but ten swords driven into their back, pinning them to the shore of the sea beneath a dark and brooding sky. In the distance, the sun rises. Tens represent completion and the ultimate manifestation of the elements of their suits, with all the lessons they’ve learned along the way. Unfortunately the ultimate lesson of the Swords is: “live by the sword, die by the sword.” Without the emotional depth of the Cups, the willpower of the Wands, or the stability of the Pentacles, the airy Swords can only destroy. Without the heart to guide it, the mind conceives and perpetrates monstrous things.

name: Page of Swords
suit: SWORDS
number: 11
image_filename: swords-11.jpg
description_upright: The Page expresses themselves with confidence and intelligence. They are curious and thirsty for knowledge.
description_reversed: All talk and no action. Haphazardness, miscommunication.
element: Earth in Air
description_long: >
  Full of enthusiasm, a young page stands atop a windy mountain swinging a sword. Pages represent communication and new ideas, and no one is bursting with either of these more than the Page of Swords. They are full of new ideas, new perspectives, keenly curious, and want to share their knowledge with the world. They are masters not only of conceiving new ideas, but also communicating them clearly to others. Being the element of earth, the Page of Swords brings common sense and relatability to the often lofty and elitist air.

name: Knight of Swords
suit: SWORDS
number: 12
image_filename: swords-12.jpg
description_upright: Rushing with the wind, the ambitious Knight is quick-thinking and driven to see their ideas become reality.
description_reversed: Restlessness, hyperactivity, and lack of focus befuddle the thoughts.
element: Air in Air
description_long: >
  A fierce Knight clad in armor rides a leaping white horse, sword drawn, cape and mantle flying in the wild winds that blow around them. The landscape is bare but for a handful of trees in the process of having their leaves torn off in the gale. Knights represent movement and the coming and going of circumstances, and this Knight is all about the going. Being Air of Air, they are all swiftness and impatience. The Knight of Swords wants his fertile ideas to be manifested NOW and will not accept delays.

name: Queen of Swords
suit: SWORDS
number: 13
image_filename: swords-13.jpg
description_upright: The fierce and independent Queen is forthright to the point of bluntness. Their clear eyes see all.
description_reversed: The heart and the head must be balanced; neither can function properly without the other.
element: Water in Air
description_long: >
  Enthroned among the clouds, a stern Queen sits with sword raised. Queens are agents of growth and centers of emotion in their suits, and the Queen of Swords’ dire message is this: grow or die. She demands that the mind be open, that beliefs are investigated and interrogated, that biases and prejudices are stripped away. Though this can seem harsh, it is for our own good, and will lead to the head and the heart being in greater harmony.

name: King of Swords
suit: SWORDS
number: 14
image_filename: swords-14.jpg
description_upright: Authority and truth reign. Be honest with yourself and others.
description_reversed: Those who use their intelligence to manipulate others may find themselves caught in their own snares.
element: Fire in Air
description_long: >
  A solemn-faced King sits upon their throne in high, rocky place, his sword raised—not as a threat, but as a reminder of their power. Kings are the motivators of their suits, the charismatic leaders who draw up plans and strategize, and the King of Swords is a natural strategist. They are not a warrior but they excel in maneuvering, planning, and attaining their goal through working smarter, not harder.
