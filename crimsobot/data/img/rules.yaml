  - Constant overstimulation
  - Not enough, I need more
  - I'll keep digging
  - He had a lot of nothing to say
  - Ranting and pointing his finger
  - So long, we wish you well
  - What's coming through is alive
  - Consideratly killing me
  - I am too connected to you
  - Insecure delusions
  - Change is coming
  - Crawling on my belly
  - Figlio di puttana
  - You think you're cool, right?
  - You know I'm involved with black magic?
  - Vans, 501s, and a dope Beastie T
  - I've got some ad-vice for you little buddy
  - Send more money
  - Eleven is standing still
  - Moving me with a sound
  - Under a dead Ohio Sky
  - Ein halbes Pfund Butter
  - Ein wenig extra Staußzucker
  - Und keine Eier
  - Saw the gap again today
  - I am somewhere I don't wanna be
  - It will end no other way
  - Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
  - Some say the end is near
  - Fret for your latte
  - Dreaming of that fix again
  - So good to see you once again
  - Blue as our new second sun
currents:
  - All this running around
  - Just let it happen
  - Tell my mother I'm sorry
  - I'll only know in the moment
  - Anticipation growing
  - It's getting closer
  - In the world my demons cultivate
  - There's no future left for you and me
  - There is another future waiting there for you
  - But I know that I'll be happier
  - With I could turn you back into a stranger
  - It feels like murder to put your heart through this
  - Someone said they left together
  - Just don't make me wait forever
  - Oh, the less I know the better
  - I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners...
  - I don't know; it just works for me.
  - Who was that? …It was my lover.
  - I used to take the long way just so I could walk past your door
  - Now it's like the world owes you
  - I wanna be like we used to
  - Like the brutal morning sun
  - It dawns on me—what have I done?
  - My weakness is the source of all my pride
  - I'm edging closer, shivers all over
  - It's way to real, I'm way too sober
  - Decisions are approaching, reality in motion
  - Does it really fucking matter, babe?
  - I've heard these words before
  - And suddenly I'm the phony one
  - Feel like a brand new person (but you'll make hte same old mistakes)
  - Well I don't care, I'm in love
  - Maybe fake's what I like
lateralus:
  - Saturn ascends
  - Clutch it like a cornerstone
  - Wear the grudge like a crown
  - But I'm still right here
  - Gonna wait it out
  - I must keep reminding myself of this
  - I know the pieces fit
  - Finding beauty in the dissonance
  - Between supposed lovers
  - So familiar and overwhelmingly warm
  - Embrancing you, this reality here
  - So wide eyed and hopeful
  - This holy reality
  - All this pain is an illusion
  - Recoginize this as a holy gift
  - Fat little parasite
  - Suck me dry
  - I hope you choke on this
  - Reaching out to embrace the random
  - Witness the beauty
  - Spiral out
  - Mention this to me
  - Mention something, mention anything
  - Watch the weather change
  - My self-indulgent pitiful hole
  - It's calling me...
  - Before I pine away...
  - I don't have a whole lot of time
  - They'll triangulate on this position really soon
  - What we're thinking of as aliens⁠—they're extradimensional beings...
