  - I've got some ad-vice for you little buddy
  - Send more money
  - Eleven is standing still
  - Moving me with a sound
  - Under a dead Ohio Sky
  - Ein halbes Pfund Butter
  - Ein wenig extra Staußzucker
  - Und keine Eier
  - Saw the gap again today
  - I am somewhere I don't wanna be
  - It will end no other way
  - Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
  - Some say the end is near
  - Fret for your latte
  - Dreaming of that fix again
  - So good to see you once again
  - Blue as our new second sun
aeroplane:
  - When you were young you were the king of carrot flowers
  - And from above you how I sank into your soul
  - Each one a little more than he would dare to try
  - I love you, Jesus Christ
  - I will float until I learn how to swim
  - Mouths open wide and spitting snow
  - What a beautiful face I have found in this place
  - Soft and sweet
  - Count every beautiful thing we can see
  - Two-headed boy all floating in glass
  - I am listening to hear where you are
  - Catching signals that sound in the dark
  - Playing pianos filled with flames
  - The Earth looks better from a star
  - He didn't mean to make you cry
  - Cars careening from the clouds
  - Sweet communist, the communist daughter
  - Wanting something warm and moving
  - Oh, comely
  - With some pretty, bright and bubbly terrible scene
  - In your memory, you're drunk on your awe to me
  - She was born in a bottle-rocket in 1929
  - All drenched in milk and holy water pouring from the sky
  - I know you live within me, feel as you fly
  - Blister, please, with those wings in your spine
  - Secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight
  - Your brains fell out through your teeth
bends:
  - You can force it but it will not come
  - You can crush it dry as a bone
  - Everything is broken
  - Where are you now when I need you?
  - Baby's got the bends
  - The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
  - Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
  - You're turning into something you're not
  - It's the best thing that you ever had
  - And it wears him out
  - She looks like the real thing
  - A cracked polystyrene man who just crumbles and burns
  - Pieces missing everywhere

  - When you've got to feel it in your bones
  - They love me like I was a brother
  - But the sea would electrocute us all
  - Nice dream
  - Can't get the stink off
  - Comes like a comet
  - And teach you how to get to purest hell
  - Suck, suck your teenage thumb
  - My brain says I'm receiving pain
  - The headshrinkers, they want everything
  - Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
  - Lead-fill the hold in me
  - Wax me, mould me, heat the pins and stab them in
  - What are we coming to?
  - Blame it on the black star
  - Troubled words of a troubled mind
  - Each time it comes it eats me alive
  - Disaffected and eager to please
  - Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
  - Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
  - I can feel their blue hands touching me
  - I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
currents:
  - All this running around
  - Just let it happen
  - Tell my mother I'm sorry
  - I'll only know in the moment
  - Anticipation growing
  - It's getting closer
  - In the world my demons cultivate
  - There's no future left for you and me
  - There is another future waiting there for you
  - But I know that I'll be happier
  - Wish I could turn you back into a stranger
  - It feels like murder to put your heart through this
  - Someone said they left together
  - Just don't make me wait forever
  - Oh, the less I know the better
  - I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners…
  - I don't know; it just works for me.
  - Who was that? …It was my lover.
  - I used to take the long way just so I could walk past your door
  - Now it's like the world owes you
  - I wanna be like we used to
  - Like the brutal morning sun

  - My weakness is the source of all my pride
  - I'm edging closer, shivers all over
  - It's way to real, I'm way too sober
  - Decisions are approaching, reality in motion
  - Does it really fucking matter, babe?
  - I've heard these words before
  - And suddenly I'm the phony one
  - Feel like a brand-new person (but you'll make the same old mistakes)
  - Well I don't care, I'm in love
  - Maybe fake's what I like
damn:
  - Is it wickedness?
  - Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
  - You have lost—you have lost—your life

  - Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
  - Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
  - My left stroke just went viral
  - Sit down. Be humble.
  - I need some water—something came over me
  - Way too high to simmer down
  - Hop on the 'gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
  - Sipping bubbly, feeling lovely, Heaven lovely—just love me
  - Keep it 💯 I'd rather you trust me than to love me
  - Give me a run for my money
  - America—God bless you if it's good to you.
  - Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis
  - This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
  - Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
  - I'm high now, I'm high now
  - I'll prob'ly die anonymous

lateralus:
  - Saturn ascends
  - Clutch it like a cornerstone
  - Wear the grudge like a crown
  - But I'm still right here
  - Gonna wait it out
  - I must keep reminding myself of this
  - I know the pieces fit
  - Finding beauty in the dissonance
  - Between supposed lovers
  - So familiar and overwhelmingly warm
  - Embracing you, this reality here
  - So wide eyed and hopeful
  - This holy reality
  - All this pain is an illusion
  - Recognize this as a holy gift
  - Fat little parasite
  - Suck me dry
  - I hope you choke on this
  - Reaching out to embrace the random
  - Witness the beauty
  - Spiral out
  - Mention this to me
  - Mention something, mention anything
  - Watch the weather change
  - My self-indulgent pitiful hole
  - It's calling me…
  - Before I pine away…
  - I don't have a whole lot of time
  - They'll triangulate on this position really soon
  - What we're thinking of as aliens⁠—they're extradimensional beings…
